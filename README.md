# javascript30-clock
The second day of the Javascript30 challenge: creating a clock using CSS and JavaScript 

Objectives
- To display an analogue clock on a single static webpage

Outcome
- I am very happy with the end result, the color palette and styling is minimalistic but overall looks nice
- The clock is functional, displays the correct time and the hands move correctly
- I was able to sneak in some refactoring to use function closures
- Good naming conventions for variables and functions

Improvements
- Instead of updating the minute and hour hand every minute, why not every second?
- Realistic tick animation, could use the css transition property
- Function closures may not be strictly necessary, there is likely a simpler implementation of the javascript logic
- Extract the logic contained in the script tags into a separate clock.js file

- Consider timing myself to see how long the project takes from start to end
